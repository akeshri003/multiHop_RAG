In states\\nlike Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya\\nPradesh and Odisha deforestation due to\\nmining have caused severe land degradation.\\nIn states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya\\nPradesh and Maharashtra overgrazing is one\\nof the main reasons for land degradation. In\\nthe states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar\\nPradesh, over irrigation is responsible for land\\ndegradation due to water logging leading to\\nincrease in salinity and alkalinity in the soil.\\nThe mineral processing like grinding of\\nlimestone for cement industry and calcite and\\nsoapstone for ceramic industry generate huge\\nquantity of dust in the atmosphere. It retards\\nthe process of infiltration of water into the soil\\nafter it settles down on the land. In recent\\nyears, industrial effluents as waste have\\nbecome a major source of land and water\\npollution in many parts of the country.\\nThere are many ways to solve the problems\\nof land degradation. Afforestation and proper\\nmanagement of grazing can help to some extent.\\nPlanting of shelter belts of plants, control on\\nover grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by\\ngrowing thorny bushes are some of the\\nmethods to check land degradation in arid\\nareas.

These\\nhave contributed in the development of various\\ntypes of soils.\\nAlluvial Soils\\nThis is the most widely spread and important\\nsoil. In fact, the entire northern plains are\\nmade of alluvial soil. These have been\\ndeposited by three important Himalayan river\\nsystem s– the Indus, the Ganga and the\\nBrahmaputra. These soils also extend in\\nRajasthan and Gujarat through a narr ow\\ncorridor.

Due\\nto its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are\\nintensively cultivated and densely populated.\\nSoils in the drier areas are more alkaline and\\ncan be productive after proper treatment and\\nirrigation.\\nBlack Soil\\nThese soils are black in colour and are also\\nknown as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for\\ngrowing cotton and is also known as black\\ncotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition\\nalong with the parent rock material are the\\nimportant factors for the formation of black\\nsoil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan\\ntrap ( Basalt) region spread over northwest\\nDeccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.\\nThey cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,\\nSaurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and\\nChhattisgarh and extend in the south east\\ndirection along the Godavari and the Krishna\\nvalleys.\\nFig. 1.6:  Alluvial Soil\\nThe alluvial soil consists of various\\nproportions of sand, silt and clay. As we move\\ninlands towards the river valleys, soil particles\\nappear some what bigger in size. In the upper\\nreaches of the river valley i.e. near the place\\nof the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such\\nsoils are more common in piedmont plains\\nsuch as Duars, Chos and Terai.\\nApart from the size of their grains or\\ncomponents, soils are also described on the\\nbasis of their age.

Yelllow\\nand red soils are also found in parts of\\nOdisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the\\nmiddle Ganga plain and along the piedmont\\nzone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop\\na reddish colour due to dif fusion of ir on in\\ncrystalline and metamorphic r ocks. It looks\\nyellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.\\nLaterite Soil\\nLaterite has been derived from the Latin word\\n‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil\\ndevelops under tropical and subtropical\\nclimate with alternate wet and dry season.\\nThis soil is the result of intense leaching due\\nto heavy rain. Lateritic soils ar\\ne mostly deep\\nto very deep, acidic (pH<6.0), generally\\ndeficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly\\nin southern states, Western Ghats region of\\nMaharashtra, Odisha, some parts of W est\\nBengal and North-east regions. Where these\\nsoils support deciduous and evergreen\\nforests, it is humus rich, but under sparse\\nvegetation and in semi-arid environment, it is\\ngenerally humus poor . They are pr one to\\nerosion and degradation due to their position\\non the landscape. After adopting appropriate\\nsoil conservation techniques particularly in\\nthe hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil\\nNadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea\\nand coffee. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu,\\nAndhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable\\nfor crops like cashew nut.\\nArid Soils\\nArid soils range from red to brown in colour.\\nThey are generally sandy in texture and saline\\nin nature.  In some areas the salt content is\\nvery high and common salt is obtained by\\nevaporating the water. Due to the dry climate,\\nhigh temperature, evaporation is faster and\\nthe soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower\\nhorizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar\\nbecause of the increasing calcium content\\ndownwards. The Kankar layer formations in\\nthe bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of\\nwater. After pr oper irrigation these soils\\nbecome cultivable as has been in the case of\\nwestern Rajasthan.\\nFig. 1.8:  Laterite Soil\\nForest Soils\\nThese soils  are found in the hilly and\\nmountainous areas where sufficient rain\\nforests are available.  The soils texture varies\\naccording to the mountain environment\\nwhere they are formed.  They are loamy and\\nsilty in valley sides and coarse grained in\\nthe upper slopes.

The soils found in the lower parts of\\nthe valleys particularly on the river terraces\\nand alluvial fans are fertile.\\nSoil Erosion and Soil Conservation\\nThe denudation of the soil cover and\\nsubsequent washing down is described as soil\\nerosion. The processes of soil formation and\\nerosion, go on simultaneously and generally\\nthere is a balance between the two. Sometimes,\\nthis balance is disturbed due to human\\nactivities like defor estation, over -grazing,\\nconstruction and mining etc., while natural\\nforces like wind, glacier and water lead to\\nsoil erosion. The running water cuts through\\nthe clayey soils and makes deep channels as\\ngullies. The land becomes unfit for cultivation\\nand is known as \\nbad land. In the Chambal\\nbasin such lands are called ravines.\\nSometimes water flows as a sheet over large\\nareas down a slope. In such cases the top\\nFig. 1.11:  Gully Erosion\\nsoil is washed away. This is known as sheet\\nerosion. W ind blows loose soil of f flat or\\nsloping land known as wind erosion. Soil\\nerosion is also caused due to defective methods\\nof farming. Ploughing in a wrong way i.e. up\\nand down the slope form channels for the\\nquick flow of water leading to soil erosion.\\nPloughing along the contour lines can\\ndecelerate the flow of water down the slopes.\\nThis is called contour ploughing. Steps can\\nbe cut out on the slopes making terraces.\\nTerrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western\\nand central Himalayas have well developed\\nterrace farming. Large fields can be divided into\\nstrips. Strips of grass are left to grow between\\nthe crops. This breaks up the force of the wind.\\nThis method is known as strip cropping.\\nPlanting lines of trees to create shelter also\\nworks in a similar way. Rows of such trees are\\ncalled shelter belts. These shelter belts have\\ncontributed significantly to the stabilisation of\\nsand dunes and in stabilising the desert in\\nwestern India.\\nFig. 1.10:  Soil Erosion\\nReprint 2024-25\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/Users/aryankeshri/Downloads/Entivin_Task/book.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='11\\nRESOURCES AND D EVELOPMENT\\nEXERCISES  EXERCISES  EXERCISES  EXERCISES  EXERCISES\\n1.

In\\nancient India, along with the sophisticated\\nhydraulic structures, there existed an\\nextraordinary tradition of water-harvesting\\nsystem. People had in-depth knowledge of\\nrainfall regimes and soil types and developed\\nwide ranging techniques to harvest\\nrainwater, groundwater, river water and flood\\nwater in keeping with the local ecological\\nconditions and their water needs. In hill and\\nmountainous regions, people built diversion\\nchannels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the\\nWestern Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop\\nrainwater harvesting’ was commonly\\npractised to store drinking water,\\nparticularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains\\nof Bengal, people developed inundation\\nchannels to irrigate their fields. In arid and\\nsemi-arid regions, agricultural fields were\\nconverted into rain fed storage structures\\nthat allowed the water to stand and moisten\\nthe soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and\\n‘Johads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.\\nIn the semi-arid and arid regions of\\nRajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi\\nand Barmer, almost all the houses\\ntraditionally had underground tanks or\\ntankas for storing drinking water.

It is, ther efore, important for us\\nto understand the main types of formations\\nin which minerals occur.\\nMinerals generally occur in these forms:\\n(i) In igneous and metamorphic rocks\\nminerals may occur in the cracks,\\ncrevices, faults or joints. The smaller\\noccurrences are called veins  and the\\nlarger are called  lodes. In most cases,\\nthey are formed when minerals in liquid/\\nmolten and gaseous forms are forced\\nupward through cavities towards the\\nearth’s surface. They cool and solidify as\\nthey rise.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between dif ferent subject areas. We hope these measur es\\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system\\nof education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must\\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\\nknowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour\\nin implementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of\\nteaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book. W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the\\nadvisory committee for textbooks in Social Sciences, at the higher\\nsecondary level, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this\\nbook, Professor M.H.
